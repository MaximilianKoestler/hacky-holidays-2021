better understand the challenge:

## Tasks

### [30 points] Printer

From the file extension and its content, we can easily conclude that we are dealing with G-code
here. The [corresponding article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) explains well what G-code is:

> G-code instructions are provided to a machine controller (industrial computer) that tells the
> motors where to move, how fast to move, and what path to follow. The two most common situations
> are that, within a machine tool such as a lathe or mill, a cutting tool is moved according to
> these instructions through a toolpath cutting away material to leave only the finished workpiece
> and/or, an unfinished workpiece is precisely positioned in any of up to nine axes around the
> three dimensions relative to a toolpath and, either or both can move relative to each other. The
> same concept also extends to noncutting tools such as forming or burnishing tools, photoplotting,
> additive methods such as 3D printing, and measuring instruments.

As the task asks for make and model of a printer, we seem to be in the second use case for G-code.

Looking at the file, we notice the section `printer start script` with some commands probably
required to set up the printer correctly. Maybe we can search for these to find other files on the
Internet that tell us, which printer is used.

A search for _"G1 X0 Y0 Z15 E0 F300" "M140 S60"_ (the first two longer lines) returns exactly one
result: https://forum.simplify3d.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=15915

In this thread someone struggles with migrating his startup code from Cura to Simplify3D. His Cura
code is identical to the part of our file and the author indeed describes what hardware he is
using:

> I am using a Geeetech A20M equipped with a BLtouch sensor to auto-level my bed.

VoilÃ ! We got make and model of the printer and our first flag: Geeetech A20M

### [70 points] Layer by Layer

Luckily, we do not have to get ourselves a 3D printer to complete this task as there are several
online tools for viewing G-code files. One of them is https://ncviewer.com/ where we can load the
file and it is rendered in the browser. However, after some processing time we are presented with
an empty grid:

![empty plane](res/empty_plane.png)

Noticing the orange line, we start scrolling and zooming out while following that line.
Finally we find a large orange unknown object:

![orange thing](res/orange_thing.png)

As the orange thing does not really help us much from ether side, we start changing the plotter
settings:

![disable rapid movement](res/disable_rapid_movement.png)

After disabling the _Show rapid movement_ option the actual object finally reveals:

![flying saucer](res/flying_saucer.png)

Moving around a bit, we discover the flag embedded in the bottom surface of the saucer:

![first impression of flag](res/first_impression_of_flag.png)

To improve the readability, we can only plot the lower part of the object. By click somewhere in
the middle of the G-code file and disabling the _Hide toolpath after position_ option, the flag
`CTF{flying_saucer}` becomes much clearer:

![flag better readable](res/flag_better_readable.png)
